In 2018, JPMorgan Chase participated in a pilot exercise to assess how various transitionrelated climate “shocks” could potentially impact the credit quality of companies in certain industries. The purpose of this exercise, which included a group of financial institutions and a third-party consultant, was to gain preliminary insight into the relationship between climate impacts and financial factors. We also sought to identify future areas of research and data that would be needed to improve the robustness of climate-related scenario analysis and stress testing over time.",Not Aligned,Partial Aligned

10,90,"Among the risks associated with physical damage caused by climate change, we adopted an approach to measure the impact on the overall credit portfolio using the default probability of a borrower that has changed because of the occurrence of floods, which have been particularly prominent in Japan and other countries in recent years in terms of both frequency of occurrence and damage level. The climate scenarios are based on the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 (2°C) and RCP8.5 (4°C) scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The RCP8.5 scenario, which expects floods to be more frequent and larger in magnitude, was analyzed to estimate the damage caused by floods using data*1 provided by various organizations. In calculating financial impact, in consideration of discussions conducted within the UNEP FI pilot project, we have reflected business suspension periods, loss arising in held assets, and other factors...Based on the results of the UNEP FI pilot project, a comprehensive approach was adopted for the measurement method, combining the bottom-up method at the individual company level and the top-down method at the sector level to assess the impact. In addition to the sustainable development scenario (thebelow2°C scenario) released by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the Network for Greening the Financial System’s (NGFS) 1.5°C scenario was used as an assumption.
